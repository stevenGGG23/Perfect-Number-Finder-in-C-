# Perfect-Number-Finder-in-C++

This C++ program identifies and displays all perfect numbers between 0 and 10,000 (exclusive). A perfect number is defined as an integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, and 3) sum up to 6.

Features:
Utilizes a function named IsPerfect to determine if a number is perfect.
Loops through integers from 1 to 9,999 and prints each perfect number found.
Efficiently calculates divisors by only iterating up to half of the number.
Usage:
Compile and run the program to see the list of perfect numbers between 0 and 10,000 displayed in the console.
The program includes an AI disclaimer to ensure originality of the work.
This repository serves as a practical example of using functions and loops in C++ to solve mathematical problems.
